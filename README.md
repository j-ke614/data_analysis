{I am analysing the top 1000 grossing movies of all time This dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/sanjeetsinghnaik/top-1000-highest-grossing-movies.}

{My Purpose for writing this simple program was to try and learn the basics of pandas.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
